Projects of Pricing Theory (stochastic analysis and financial theory as it applies to financial derivative products) (2022 Fall). 

**Project 1**: Price American Option (Binomial Tree) with stochastic underlying asset. Exercise Boundary, Hedging Strategy, Profit and Loss, Distribution of the time at which you exercise the option. Asset price Simulation.

(Derive the underlying asset Log-normal Price Process.

Derive two probability measures. One is Q, refers to the martingale measure induced by using the bank account B as a numeraire. The other is Q_S, refers to the martingale measure induced by using the asset S as a numeraire.)



**Project 2**: Delta-Gamma Hedging in discrete time within the Black-Scholes model. Sold an at-the-money 1/4 year put written on the underlying asset and to hedge. Hedge with both the Move-Based and the Time-Based by Delta and Delta-Gamma hedging strategy repectively.
